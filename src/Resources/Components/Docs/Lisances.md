### Permissive Licenses

1. **[MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit)**: This is one of the most permissive licenses. It allows users to do almost anything with the software, including making and distributing closed-source versions. The only requirement is to include the original copyright notice and a copy of the license.
2. **[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)**: Similar to the MIT License, but with additional provisions to handle contributions and patents. It requires preservation of the license and notices, and it provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.
3. **[BSD Licenses](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause)**: There are several variants, but they generally allow for redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, as long as the original copyright notice and disclaimers are retained.

### Copyleft Licenses

1. **[GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)**: This is a strong copyleft license that requires any modified versions of the software to also be open source and distributed under the same license. It ensures that the software and its derivatives remain free.
2. **[GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)**: A weaker copyleft license compared to the GPL. It allows linking with non-(L)GPLed software, making it more suitable for libraries.
3. **[Affero General Public License (AGPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)**: Similar to the GPL, but with an additional requirement that if the software is used over a network, the source code must be made available to the users of the network service.

### Weak Copyleft Licenses

1. **[Mozilla Public License (MPL)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/)**: This license allows the code to be mixed with other code under different licenses, but any modifications to the MPL-licensed code itself must be made available under the MPL.
2. **[Eclipse Public License (EPL)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/)**: Similar to the MPL, it allows for combining with other code under different licenses, but modifications to the EPL-licensed code must be shared under the same terms.
